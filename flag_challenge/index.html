    Your mission is to draw a flag of the United States by writing code in <code>script.js</code>. This environment provides two
    methods: <code>drawFilledRect(x, y, w, h, color)</code> which draws a filled
    rectangle with its top left at x,y and width w and height h, and 
    <code>drawStar(x, y, d, color)</code> that draws a single filled star centered at x,y with diameter d. It also provides
    five variables, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> variables specifying the
    size of the drawing area and <code>RED</code>, <code>WHITE</code>, and <code>BLUE</code> which
    provide the color values for the official shades of red, white, and blue for
    the flag.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your flag must follow the proportions set out in the US code as summarized in
    this <a target="_blank" href="https://itp.gigamonkeys.com/playgrounds/flag/spec/">US Flag specification</a>. In addition to being properly
    proportioned, your flag should be 90% of the size of the largest
    properly-proportioned flag that could fit in the drawing area and should be
    centered horizontally and vertically.
